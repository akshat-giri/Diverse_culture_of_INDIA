                    <p>The Taj Mahal is a mosque like building and tomb built in the 16th century by the Mughal emperor,
                        Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

                        The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Widely thought as one of the most beautiful
                        buildings in the world, it is one of India's biggest tourist attractions.

                        It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with the Agra Fort, 2.5 kilometers away.
                        It was listed as one of the 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. It is located on the south bank of
                        Yamuna river in Agra. It is a splendid monument, but because of pollution, the Taj Mahal is
                        turning yellow. It Is one of the most notable Islamic architectures built by the Mughals in
                        India. </p>

                    <p>The highest ‘stone tower’ of India that is located in Delhi is called the ‘Qutub Minar’ or also
                        spelled as ‘Qutb Minar.’ This tower was built in 1193 and is now declared as a UNESCO World
                        Heritage Site. It symbolizes a significant time of Indian history and also contributes to an
                        attraction for travel and tourism. Qutub Minar has eventually grown to be a part of our culture,
                        along with history. And people often keep the tower as a must on their site-seeing list while
                        traveling to Delhi.

                        We are providing long and short essay samples on the topic of Qutub Minar to help students. And
                        we are also offering ten pointers on the topic so that the students can use them as a reference
                        while structuring their essays. </p>

                    <p>The Konark or Konarak Sun temple is dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya, and, conceived as a
                        giant stone chariot with 12 wheels, it is the most famous of the few sun temples built in India.
                        It is located about 35 km northeast of the city of Puri on the coastline in the state of Odisha
                        (earlier Orissa). It was built c. 1250 CE by King Narasimhadeva I (r. 1238-1264 CE) of the
                        Eastern Ganga dynasty (8th century CE - 15th century CE). The temple in its present state was
                        declared by UNESCO a World Heritage Site in 1984 CE. </p>
